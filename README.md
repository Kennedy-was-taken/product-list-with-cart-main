<!-- ### What I learned

  1. Creating a Click Outside Directive in Angular:

      - Implemented a click outside directive within Angular to facilitate the closing of modal windows, tooltips, or dropdown menus.
      - Linked the directive to the HTML tag to ensure that clicking outside the designated area triggers the closing action.
      - Ensured that clicking within the designated area keeps the component open.

  2. Utilizing '@angular/animations' for Basic Animations:

      - Learned to integrate '@angular/animations' to animate sidebar actions in TypeScript.
      - Manipulated the opacity of a layer using triggers, states, transitions, and animations.
      - Implemented animations for opening and closing actions, enhancing user experience and interface interactivity.

  3. CSS Transformations and Animations:

      - Refreshed understanding of CSS transformations for manipulating the positioning of HTML elements at various keyframes.
      - Employed CSS animations to define animation properties, enabling keyframes to animate according to specified parameters.
      - By mastering these techniques, I've enhanced my ability to create dynamic and interactive user interfaces within Angular applications. -->
